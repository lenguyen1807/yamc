> NOTE: This code has been test only on MacOS (but maybe can work on Linux, remember I do not support Windows so you should know what to do if you want to run this on Windows).

You need to install `OpenMP` and `OpenCV`. Using `brew` as below:
```cpp
brew install llvm
brew install libomp
brew install opencv
```
